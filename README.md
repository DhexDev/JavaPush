This is a very raw example of how to implement server side push notifications
on a java server, without deeling with the google auth or the firebase dependencies.

This code makes use of almost no non existing libraries provided by standadr java,
being the only exception GSON, wich is my favorite jSON parser, but feel free to use
any jSON encoder/decoder you like. 

This code can easily be ported to other server side languages such as Python or Php
by an AI.

If you are having a hard time implementing Google rabithole dependencies, maybe this
will be usefull.
